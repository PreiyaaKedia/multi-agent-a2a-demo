# Update resource names and parameters in infra/main.bicep or pass parameters during `azd up`.

# Notes:
# - This file gives azd enough information to link the project to the infra.
# - You can run `azd up` from the repo root to provision infra and deploy all three agents.
# - Each agent will be deployed to its own App Service instance with dedicated UAI for security.
